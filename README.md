# RANDOM

## Update 20/6/21:

Currently, the `RanInt()` function has been completed. You are welcome to test it out, although there may be certain issues with it. Here are some details about the function:

#### `RanInt(minimum, maximum, quantity = 1, iterations = None, atype = None)` 

#### Use

This function generates random integers within a predefined range, which are presented in a list.

##### `minimum`

The minimum number of the range.

##### `maximum`

The maximum number of the range.

##### `quantity`

How many random integers you want to generate. Default is 1.

##### `iterations`

How many random integers, whose average is taken afterwards, you want to generate. If value is `not None`, value of `atype` cannot be `None`.

##### `atype`

Choose what type of average you want to take from the previously mentioned integers generated in `iterations`. Available options are `mean`, `median`, `mode` and `rand`. `rand` randomly picks one of the averages.
